To setup the projects you simply install Anaconda and open them in Jupyter Notebook/Lab and after installing the necessary extensions through the `conda` or `pip` command in your _Anaconda Terminal_. Mostly you will only have to run:

- `pip install opencv-python` for the image recognition and manipulation library.
- `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch` for PyTorch **Only run this if you are using Anaconda on Win 10 and programing with Python** else, I will not be updating this command for each new Pytorch, Python or CUDA update, so please check the offical site for the command: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

If your Jupyter program gets stuck, you are probably just missing some other libraries and just find them and include them.
